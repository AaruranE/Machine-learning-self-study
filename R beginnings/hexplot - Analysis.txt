There are weird pockets of no landings in the middle of continents. 

E.g. at about +40 latitude, -100 longitude. This location is Colorado, a mountainous state. I assume that meteorites would probably be caught in mountainous regions and never found for that reason. 
-----
Consider 0 latitude, 0 longitude. 2 or 3 hexagons of no landings.

This region is part of the South Atlantic Ocean, and the countries which share a coast with this region are Nigeria, Cameroon, Ghana, etc. 

Pop. of Ghana: 27 mill;
Pop. of Nigeria: 182 mill;
Pop. of Cameroon: 23 mill;

Highly populated region, and no landings. Why? Probably just landings into the ocean that go unrecorded.
